#Password Creator
This is a homework assignment to build a password generator. The generator should allow you to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters, and allow you to choose from up to 4 classes of characters: upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. The project is a mix of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
All of these inputs are displayed in the form of alerts. 

#Operation
To use this application, navigate to the deployed site (see below), and press the red button. The user will then navigate through several prompts to determine the length of the password and what type of characters will be used. After that, a password will be generated.

#Deployment
The link to the application is:  https://razzlejazzled.github.io/Password-Creator/
